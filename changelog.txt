v1.5.7  - (TBA)
        - PATCH: Thanks to @Martinski, some significant improvements were made to the email notification feature
          and functionality. HTML emails are now being sent by default, and have been tested using all major email
          providers. A new title header is now visible in the email, as well as the ability to bold characters.
          Looking at adding a secondary email address in the near future as that capability has now been built-in
          as well, which could optionally be used for text messaging.
        - PATCH: Noticed that when the "scheduled backup" item was set to "No", that one of its sub-items continued
          to stay active. Now, when this item is set to no, both the time and backup modes are grayed out.

v1.5.6  - (February 18, 2024)
        - PATCH: Thanks for @ExtremeFiretop's suggestion to provide guidance and automation to exclude the backup
          folder if EXT USB backups are backing up to the same EXT USB. Knowing that his is a risky scenario, 
          should your EXT USB fail, you will lose all your backups in the process. Also, if your backup folder
          is not being excluded in the TAR exclusion file, your previous backups will be backed up each time,
          exponentially increasing their size and the time it takes to back them up. Warnings will now also be
          displayed on screen and in the logs indicating this risk, and whether or not the backup folder is being
          excluded. When choosing a source or target path, or backup folder path, BACKUPMON will evaluate whether
          or not your backup folder needs to be excluded, giving ample language describing the issue and allowing
          you to automatically add the exclusion.
        - PATCH: Moved and added some items around on the setup menu, including now the ability to edit your
          primary and secondary exclusion files (options: 'ep' and 'es'). Performing this action will launch your
          exclusion files with the NANO text editor, allowing you to free-form edit any items you wish to add,
          delete or modify. Remember to save: CTRL-O + enter.  To exit: CTRL-X.
        - PATCH: Minor fixes around the secondary backup setup screen, to add some logic to prompt for a mount
          point should the backup media type change from USB to Network or vice versa. 

v1.5.3  - (February 14, 2024)
        - MINOR: Added new functionality to BACKUPMON to give you the ability to receive backup SUCCESS and 
          FAILURE email notifications. This capability is provided through the AMTM Email functionality (AMTM->em)  
          and made possible through a wonderful common library graciously made available by @Martinski! When you 
          enable the AMTM email notification functionality in the config menu (option #14), the script will
          download a library file into /jffs/addons/shared-libs. Libraries and functions like these can be shared 
          between many other scripts from one common location. In BACKUPMON, you can enable notifcations for either
          SUCCESS or FAILURE events, or both. If using primary and secondary backups, you will get notifications
          for both, whether they succeed or fail. PLEASE NOTE: AMTM Email (AMTM->em) must be set up, configured 
          and working before enabling this functionality in BACKUPMON.
        - PATCH: Changed the versioning logic to align with the general accepted way of versioning, using the
          notation: major.minor.patch ... finally, right? After seeing @thelonelycoder changing his ways, I
          figured it was probably time for me as well. All my scripts moving forward will go this route. Change
          log wording is now changed to conform to the major/minor/patch standards. So previously, FIXED now
          conforms to PATCH, ADDED conforms to MINOR, and MAJOR stays the same!
        - PATCH: Due to an overlap of common variable names when integrating with AMTM, some mitigations had to be
          made and will change the username and password variable names within the backupmon.cfg upon start. This
          will run 1x only once variable names have been corrected.
        - PATCH: Added AMTM Email testing as a menu item off the main setup menu. This allows you to give the AMTM
          email capabilities a quick test, providing verbose on-screen feedback during the process.

v1.46   - (January 31, 2024)
        - ADDED: File integrity checks for the tar.gz files created containing JFFS and Ext USB Drive data. After
          creation of these files, an integrity check executes to ensure that the file is intact before moving on
          to the next step. If it returns an integrity error, the script will force an exit with an error
          message/code. While it would probably be pretty rare that tar.gz files actually fail to get created, but
          even if they were successfully created and still fail an integrity check, there could be bigger problems
          going on with the network, hardware or disk issues. Keep an eye on those logs!
        - ADDED: Many thanks to @Martinski for adding a great function that will help determine the EXT USB Drive
          label, and will return null if one isn't set. It's actually been quite a hurdle to determine what's
          plugged into the back of your router with the different variations things can take within the OS. Your
          help and expertise is truly appreciated! :)

v1.44   - (January 28, 2024)
        - ADDED: More error checking on creation of TAR files to determine if the script needs to force an exit
          due to some colossal disk or network issue when writing TAR files. Changed many other error exit codes
          to produce something usable when looking for script success or failure when running a backup from
          commandline (ie. the -backup switch). Honored to collaborate with @ExtremeFiretop and @Martinski with 
          their MerlinAU script, so BACKUPMON may run and check for a successful backup prior to running an
          automated FW update.
        - FIXED: In the setup/config, when choosing USB or Network as your target media type (option #2), it will
          blank out your backup target mount point (option #6), and give you a visual indication that "ACTION IS
          NEEDED" for this item. In certain situations, the source and target mount points could be the same name,
          and if the media type had "network" as the default media type, while the mount points were pointing to
          an External USB drive, then the USB drive would get unmounted after a backup. Many thanks to
          @ExtremeFiretop for finding that doozy! :)

v1.43   - (January 13, 2024)
        - FIXED: When selecting to import your primary backup settings in the connection testing tool, it would
          not bring over the SMB version, and continue to give you the default. This has been fixed to now bring
          over your custom SMB setting. Thanks much to @Tallion_o7 for the heads-up!

v1.42   - (December 23, 2023)
        - ADDED: Added a new option #9 under the config menu based on feedback from @ScottW. This option allows
          you to specify if you want to back up the swap file. By default, the swap file will now be excluded from
          backups as we have now seen that restoring a backup with a swap file contained within will have problems
          restoring to a system that already has an existing swap file. If the user does not choose an exclusion
          file, BACKUPMON will create an exclusion file, and specify the name of the swap file to be excluded from
          backup. You still have the ability to maintain your own exclusion file with your own custom entries. If
          a custom exclusion file is in place without the swap file name included, BACKUPMON will add the swap
          file name to your custom exclusion file before the next backup. If you really want to back up your swap
          file, simply set this configuration setting to "Yes", and the script will remove any references to the
          swap file name from your exclusions files.
        - ADDED: More logic around the restore process to catch any errors during the TAR file restore back to the
          External USB drive. If the process encounters any errors, you will be prompted to enter either a Y or N
          to proceed or stop the restore process. This was added in response to the experience that @ScottW had
          described, where the TAR restore encountered errors restoring the swap file, and proceeded to restore
          the router config, and rebooted immediately after. This will give that needed pause to determine whether
          or not to proceed.
        - FIXED: Included some more language around the need for an exclusions.txt file, and if not used, that the
          user might face larger-than-normal backups which also will take much longer, because the swap file will
          be included in that backup. Thanks to @bibikalka for the suggestion!

v1.40   - (November 20, 2023)
        - ADDED: You now have the ability to choose which version of the CIFS/SMB protocol you want to use. Thanks
          to @vaboro, you can choose between using v1.0, v2.0, v2.1 (default), v3.0 and v3.02. This is especially
          useful when connecting to older hardware that may not be able to support the later versions, as it is 
          apparent that older NAS or routers are still in use that need this for backwards compatibility.
        - FIXED: Changed some of the logic around detecting the primary EXT USB drive in order to determine its
          label name. This is used to present a warning if the label is blank. Before, it would not let the user
          proceed, but now it just gives a 10sec warning before continuing, and gives some suggestions on what
          to label the drive, and that in its current state, may have consequences on the operation of BACKUPMON.
          Thanks to @_m4t3u_ and @TheMorpN for bringing this to light.
        - FIXED: Thanks to a suggestion from @thelonelycoder, after the script downloads an update, it will no
          longer ask the user to exit and restart. Now using the exec command, the script restarts by itself, and
          goes back to the -setup menu.

v1.38   - (November 13, 2023)
        - FIXED: On the heels of RMerlin's 386.12_2 release, I realized that the FW build values I was pulling did
          not include the minor version "_2", and continued to pull just "386.12" when querying this information.
          RMerlin explained that the minor version is captured under the EXTENDNO variable under nvram. Made a
          slight tweak to the way this is now being captured and documented, as it's used when comparing what was
          backed up vs. what is being restored, and issuing the proper warning should these values not match, and
          hopefully prevent someone from restoring a FW CFG from an older version onto a newer version, and
          possibly borking up their router.

v1.37   - (November 12, 2023)
        - ADDED: By popular demand, BACKUPMON now features a dedicated log file, located under
          /jffs/addons/backupmon.d/backupmon.log. You can access this log by hitting "vl" from the setup and
          operations menu, and will use the NANO text editor to open the log. Exit NANO using CTRL-X. All major
          events that you would see on-screen are displayed in the log. Certain major items continue to be
          displayed in the main SYSLOG just incase people are utilizing these someway. I will continue pruning,
          adding and correcting items as needed. The logfile won't exceed 5000 lines, and will keep itself
          trimmed automatically, so there won't be any space concerns in /jffs.
        - FIXED: Thanks to @Ripshod, found an invalid reference where the secondary backups were referring to the
          primary exclusion list file for weekly backups. Corrected the issue.

v1.35   - (November 10, 2023)
        - ADDED: Created a secondary commandline switch (-bw) that will launch the script in single color B/W.
          Thanks to some creative suggestions from @PeterT and an extreme dislike of any form of color within
          scripts from @ColinTaylor, which helped give me a push in this direction. Instructions: The -bw switch
          much be used secondarily to any other switch... such as "backupmon.sh -backup -bw", or when using
          "backupmon.sh -setup -bw". Using a switch like this would allow you to then dump screenwrites to a log
          file without all the messy color escape characters, and make it much more readable. It's not perfect,
          but in lieu of creating a separate log file (on to-do list), this will make do.
        - ADDED: For the capability to distinguish between directly attached USB backup devices, and network
          backup devices using a new menu item, available in the config menu. (See item #2). You will also need to
          indicate whether your backup target is a "Network" or "USB" device. In the case of a USB Backup Target 
          (directly attached to your router), the script will no longer mount or unmount the device before or after
          a backup has been completed. It will also use the mount point selector to let you chose an already mounted
          USB device. By default, "Network" is selected, which in this case requires you to fill in a mount point
          name of your choice that the script will create for you. Thanks much to @Quoc Huynh for the helpful
          suggestion, and for the extensive testing done by @visortgw!
        - ADDED: New functionality to the scheduler menu item, asking if you want the script to simply run a backup,
          or if you want it to run a backup + autopurge. If you chose the latter, it will add the "-backup" switch
          to the cron job. Please note: when running "backupmon.sh" standalone, you will only run a backup job. If
          you run "backupmon.sh -backup", it will run a backup followed by an autopurge for those who are running
          in "perptual backup frequency" mode. This is just an automated way to keep your backups trimmed per the
          age that you have specified. This item is now also featured under the config menu (under item #11) for easy
          reference. Please make sure you save your config!
        - FIXED: The order of the config menu items for the primary, secondary and test backup menu items have been
          optimized. It now starts with determining what type of media the target device is, and using this info, will
          determine if menu items need to get grayed out. In the case of selecting the USB option, it will also now
          force the use of @Martinski's excellent mount point selector!
        - FIXED: Many verbiage changes in the config menu to help standardize terms.
        - FIXED: @Martinski has worked some magic on his mount point selector functions to catch unexpected characters
          in your drive labels. PRO TIP: Please try to keep your drive labels as plain as possible. Ex: SAMSUNG-SSD
        - FIXED: The annoying bug that @visortgw identified when choosing USB, the script would still complain if one
          of the passwords was plaintext, eventhough it would not even get used in this scenario. When USB is selected
          as a target backup device, checking for plaintext passwords will no longer come under scrutiny.

v1.31   - (November 5, 2023)
        - FIXED: @Martinski was gracious enough to add a few fixes to his mount path selector function in order to
          eliminate some extraneous UBI drive references. Also, if only one external drive is attached, it will
          automatically select that without needing to display a selection menu.
        - FIXED: Gave -purge mode a little more context on-screen, and fixed the exit back to a prompt after running
          since it incorrectly started a backup afterwards.
        - MINOR: Fixed some grammar for a few on-screen messages based on the variable language they were displaying.

v1.30   - (November 4, 2023)
        - ADDED: Implemented an awesome EXT USB drive mount path selector, courtesy of @Martinski! This nice feature
          now allows you to pick a drive/partition other than sda1, which was the only supported backup source up
          until now. This selector is available under configuration menu item #4. If an alternate selection is not
          made, by default it will continue to backup your EXT USB drive that is mapped to sda1. Please note: 
          BACKUPMON will only backup 1 drive/partition. It does not and will not support configurations consisting
          of multiple partitions.
        - ADDED: Included the EXT USB drive mount path on the top of the screen when backups run, which is displayed
          alongside other settings, to give you some quick at-a-glance feedback on what's being backed up, where.
        - ADDED: Included the amount of time a backup takes, and will now show an on-screen status that the main
          EXT USB backup is starting, and to please stand by... It will calculate and show how many seconds the
          backup took, and will also write this same info to the syslog. Thanks to @monakh for the good suggestion!
        - FIXED: When a regular backup runs with purge enabled, I have fixed the screen output to now flow along with
          the regular backup feedback, and no longer clears screens/displays BACKUPMON headers, etc.

v1.27   - (October 24, 2023)
        - FIXED: BACKUPMON will now remove any remaining copy of backupmon.cfg in the /jffs/scripts folder should you
          have performed a restore. This was causing some conflicts between it and a similar copy that was located
          under the /jffs/addons/backupmon.d/ folder. Thanks to @Ripshod for finding this!
        - FIXED: Now testing to see if your EXT USB drive label is blank, and will require having at least a 2-char
          value before being able to run. It is important to name your devices, and not keep them blank/null. This
          wreaks havoc on all kinds of stuff. Please use this as a best-practice for any device you interact with.
          Just give it a name. All one word, no spaces, no crazy special characters. It's certainly easier to identify
          what device is having problems should you ever need to troubleshoot.
        - CHANGED: Incorporated changes to the way passwords are being saved, now using the base64 method suggested by
          @PeterT and @ColinTaylor. Passwords are now encoded via base64 and saved to your config file. PLEASE NOTE:
          this change will require you to go into your config, and resave your passwords into proper base64 encoding.
          I've added a test to the script to determine if your passwords need to be resaved, and will direct you to
          the setup menu. This means your passwords can now be overly complex, using special characters, including the
          \ and $ characters, which normally cause all kinds of trouble in these kinds of scripts. Many thanks goes to
          @Somewhereovertherainbow for his help coming up with a clever way to grep openssl to determine valid base64
          passwords or invalid plaintext passwords!
        - ADDED: Included the current model/firmware/build in the instructions.txt file, including a warning not to
          restore your router from an older firmware/build or model type, or you may face possibly bricking your
          router. This info is now also shown within the setup menu, and is written to a routerfw.txt file located
          under each of your backup folders. This is to keep track what router model/firmware build each backup was
          taken with. When going through a restore, BACKUPMON will compare your router's current model/firmware/build
          and compare it to the model/firmware/build found in the backup folder's routerfw.txt file... if they match,
          it proceeds with an uninterrupted restore. If it notices a difference, it will give you explicit warnings not
          to proceed, and asks you whether or not you want to continue, but won't stop you from overwriting your router
          with an older configuration from a previous firmware. This is done at your own risk. I built this roadblock
          to prevent people from possibly unknowingly damaging their routers if they happen to restore an older
          firmware, or think they can restore a backup from an RT-AC86U to a GT-AX6000 (or the like). 
        - ADDED: Included a ping test in the backup target network connection tester functionality. Thought this would
          be a worthy add-on when troubleshooting getting your router talking to your backup target. Please note, your
          backup target must have capabilities of returning icmp/ping requests to show valid results, but this won't
          stop the testing process.
        - ADDED: Added the ability to import your primary or secondary backup settings into the Backup Target Network
          Connection Tester. Thanks to @PeterT for the suggestion!

v1.22   - (October 2, 2023)
        - FIXED: Thanks to @maghuro, in a situation where an EXT USB drive would not be connected to the router, it 
          would experience some issues backing itself up, throwing some errors and whatnot because this situation was 
          never considered. Logic was added to factor in a missing EXT USB drive, and will now backup and restore only 
          the JFFS and NVRAM components.
        - MINOR: Added a missing logger statement to indicate that the NVRAM was backed up (primary & secondary) that
          was being left out of the syslogs after a backup.

v1.20   - (September 27, 2023)
        - MAJOR: Added the capability of running backups to a secondary backup target! Many thanks to @visortgw for
          the suggestion! Item #10 in the configuration utility allows you to configure all necessary information to
          set up a secondary backup target. You can choose a completely different kind of backup frequency compared
          to your primary backup method, and will also be able to be purged/autopurged should you allow it. Also, if
          secondary backups are enabled, when you run the restoration procedure, it will prompt you whether you want
          to restore from your primary or secondary backup source. When you install this version, **please** make
          sure you save a new configuration from the configuration utility as many new variables have been added to
          keep track of this functionality.
        - MAJOR: Added a Backup Target Network Connection Tester... in a situation where you might be setting up a new
          device, or just trying to troubleshoot, it's easier to just try your username/password, UNC path, local drive
          mount path and target network folders from this utility than beating your head against trying to run a backup
          with these settings. You receive on-screen feedback when things are going right or wrong. When you have
          achieved success, test backup folders will be created under your network target, and a testfile will have
          been written to ensure you have proper read/write permissions. When the connection tester reports success,
          you can copy those settings over to your primary network backup config. This item is found under the Setup +
          Operations Menu, item "TS" allows you to run this utility. 
        - MINOR: Added a notification in the configuration utility to remind you to save when new activity has been
          noticed. 
        - MINOR: General improvements to visual consistency and messaging.

v1.18   - (September 20, 2023)
        - FIXED: Bug associated with generating a correct CRON statement. Thanks to @Stephen Harrington for the
          catch. Minutes and hours were reversed, and has been corrected.

v1.17   - (September 18, 2023)
        - FIXED: Bugs associated with adding a CRON job were found while adding the request that @Ripshod made note
          of, and now updates the cru job with the correct time if you happen to change the time without the need to
          first disable and then re-enable the backup scheduler!

v1.16   - (September 18, 2023)
        - FIXED: Another minor bug fix that was preventing the -purge switch from working correctly. Many thanks to
          @Stephen Harrington for identifying that!
        - ADDED: By request, if you have enabled "Purge Backups" in the configuration menu, then auto purge will
          automatically run if you call BACKUPMON with the -backup switch, ie: "sh backupmon.sh -backup". After it
          completes a backup, it will auto purge any backups that fall in range with the set number of days value. You
          can still run BACKUPMON without auto purging, even if "Purge Backups" is enabled, by just running BACKUPMON
          without switches, ie: "sh backupmon.sh".  Thanks to @Stephen Harrington for the good idea!

v1.15   - (September 17, 2023)
        - FIXED: Minor bug fix preventing a new install from getting into setup! So much for optimizations! :) Thanks
          much to @visortgw for the catch!

v1.14   - (September 17, 2023)
        - MAJOR: Added an auto-purge feature! Based on the existing purge feature from the operations section under the
          setup menu, when calling "sh backupmon.sh -purge", it will use the purge settings you have configured to trim
          your perpetual backups without any user input. You can utilize this switch in conjunction with a daily CRON job
          to keep your backups trimmed.
        - ADDED: Thanks to @visortgw, added functionality to bypass the 10 second initial timer when using the -backup
          switch. If BACKUPMON is called without switches, it will use the 10 second timer.
        - MINOR: General improvements to visual spacing, messaging and logging.

v1.12   - (September 16, 2023)
        - FIXED: You guys are getting a BOGO today. Thanks to @ColinTaylor for the recommendation to immediately force a 
          reboot after restoring the NVRAM.cfg file, instead of prompting the user to choose y/n. I agree... this should
          be done immediately after, just like when restoring NVRAM from the UI.
        - ADDED: Good suggestion from @maghuro to check to make sure the source/target routers are the same, so that
          people aren't trying to restore an RT-AC86U backup onto a GT-AX6000, thinking this is all fine and all. Added
          some logic in there that captures router model and saves it to your config, and will compare that to the router
          model when you start a restore. This is the best attempt I can come up with to prevent people from bricking
          their router, and a last stop-gap measure to prevent a restore from doing potential damage. Please make sure you
          save a fresh copy of your configs as this value will need to be written before a restore can happen.

v1.1    - (September 16, 2023)
        - MAJOR: Many thanks to @maghuro and @ColinTaylor for their advice on NVRAM backups! BACKUPMON will now not only
          take backups of JFFS, your external USB drive, but also NVRAM! These 3 backups are stored under each of your
          daily folders. In case of a restore, these snapshots will work in concert together to bring your router back to
          its exact same state as before, settings and ALL!
        - FIXED: Some minor instruction verbiage changes in the restore instructions, as I blew away my old AC86U during
          the testing process of getting it restored back to a previous state with BACKUPMON. 

v1.02   - (September 15, 2023)
        - ADDED: Thanks to @maghuro and @alan6854321 for the suggestion to include a copy of the NVRAM settings. Please
          note... this extract is for reference purposes only, and cannot be used to import old NVRAM values back into
          your router. The 'nvram.txt' file is now included with the other assortment of files that are exported into
          the root of your external backup folder.
        - FIXED: Thanks to @maghuro for finding the typo in the config for the username/password labels.

v1.0    - (September 14, 2023)
        - RELEASE:  I'm satisfied... let's go live!

v0.92RC - (September 12, 2023)
        - FIXED: Issue where when backupmon was newly downloaded and installed, the setup menu would be going through a
          loop because it was referencing that the .cfg file was not found, and telling you to run setup. All fixed!

v0.91RC - (September 10, 2023)
        - ADDED: Major new functionality to help purge perpetual backups, with much thanks to @Martinski for supplying a
          great function to help with this! Under the config menu, when selecting "perpetual" backup frequency, you will
          have the option to choose whether you want to enable backup purging for everything older than a certain number
          of days. Once configured, you can access the purge backups functionality under the operations area under the
          setup menu. This function will step you through multiple prompts before committing to delete any backups, and
          will show you which backups are affected. PLEASE NOTE: deleting backups is permanent, and advise caution on what
          you are deleting, and ensure that the list presented to you is what you want deleted. Also, PLEASE NOTE: if there
          are any backups that you want to save or store for later use, PLEASE move these to a SAFE and otherwise secure
          location outside of the backup folder structure that BACKUPMON utilizes, else there will be a chance these
          backups will get deleted. I will be keeping the purge backups utility manual for the time being, giving you more
          control over when and what gets deleted. I may automate this in the future depending on demand.
        - RELEASE CANDIDATE: This completes all work for the release candidate. I will be taking another week to thoroughly
          test all functionality before releasing v1.0! 

v0.9RC  - (September 9, 2023)
        - ADDED: Major new functionality was added to give you an additional backup frequency choice... So in addition to
          weekly, monthly and yearly backup frequencies, you will now have a 'perpetual' option. (Thanks to @Stephen
          Harrington for the suggestion!) In this mode, instead of a Mon-Fri, 01-31 or 001-365 folder being created for the
          weekly, monthly or yearly backup frequencies, a unique folder based on date/time is created when the backup runs.
          For example: 20230909-092021. In this mode, only BASIC mode backups are allowed, which provide for a simpler
          naming convention, and easier restoration process. When using the 'perpetual frequency' option under BASIC mode,
          backups are not pruned, nor are they overwritten if multiple backups are taken on the same day. In this case, a
          new, uniquely named backup folder is created each time.

v0.8RC  - (September 8, 2023)
        - ADDED: Major new functionality to choose between the mode of BACKUPMON: Basic or Advanced. Here is the difference
          between this functionality (formally called, @Stephen Harrington Mode) <tongue-in-cheek>:

              BASIC
              - Only backs up one backup set per daily folder
              - Backup file names have standard names based on jffs and USB drive label names
              - Self-prunes the daily backup folders by deleting contents before backing up new set
              - Will overwrite daily backups, even if multiple are made on the same day
              - Restore more automated, and only required to pick which day to restore from

              ADVANCED
              - Backs up multiple daily backup sets per daily folder
              - Backup file names contain extra unique date and time identifiers
              - Keeps all daily backups forever, and no longer self-prunes
              - Will not overwrite daily backups, even if multiple are made on the same day
              - Restore more tedious, and required to type exact backup file names before restore

          Please note, that during a restore in advanced mode, you will be able to see the files under the directories
          you specify, but you will be required to enter in the EXACT full filename of the JFFS and USB backup filenames
          you wish to have restored. 

        - ADDED: New menu items under the setup menu, allow you to launch a backup or restore. Thanks to @Kingp!n for the
          suggestion!

v0.7RC  - (September 7, 2023)
        - FIXED: Added logic to watch for mount/umount failures, and will keep trying to mount or dismount for up to 2 minutes
          before giving up due to a failure. The error will be written to the syslog.

v0.6RC  - (September 5, 2023)
        - ADDED: Ability to set a scheduled daily CRON job with the time of your choice. This function will create the 
          necessary cru statement in your /jffs/scripts/service-start file, and add it to CRON as well. Unselecting this
          choice will remove it from both CRON and the service-start file. This item can be configured under the config
          menu, item #7.
        - ADDED: Ability to choose between 3 different backup frequency strategies. You get to choose between cycling through
          a week, a month, or a year. The week selection, it will create folders from Mon - Sun.  With the month (standard), 
          it creates folder from day 01 through day 31... and with the year, day 001 all the way through day 365. You better
          be prepared to allocate some space. ;)  You can pick your backup frequency under the config menu, item #8.
        - FIXED: Based on some feedback, I reworked the way modprobe is being used. No longer using the build of the FW as a
          and indicator, but as Jeff suggested, just seeing if the file exists, and if it does, use it. 

v0.5RC  - (September 4, 2023)
        - RELEASE: First release candidate of BACKUPMON! After some extensive backup and restoration testing, I believe it's
          ready for the masses to try out! :)
